# CS-1810-Final-Project
Home Design Site

This project serves as the final project for CS 1810 (Intro to Web Development) as well 
as fulfills the requirements for Sarah's Honors Contract as outlined below:

"To receive Honors credit for participation in CS 1810 (Intro to Web Development), Sarah 
will expand upon the final project requirements by building a website to market a small 
business of creating and selling house designs. The website will include at least one 3D 
click-and-draggable demo of an example house design, which will be programmed using the 
Three.js library/API. In order to incorporate this aspect of her final project, Sarah 
will undertake additional research to learn how to use Three.js, the sources for which 
will include the Safari/Oâ€™Reilly database and other online resources. Sarah will also 
conduct user interviews at at least three different stages of her project to acquire user 
feedback, which she will use to improve her site. This project will incorporate inter-
disciplinary connections by providing Sarah with opportunities for the pursuit of entre-
preneurial experience and for the development of communication and interpersonal skills."
