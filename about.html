                <p>HomeVisualize is a small business started in 2022 and based in Eagle
                    Mountain, Utah. Sarah--the owner, founder, and only current employee--is 
                    a college student with aspirations to earn a bachelor's degree in 
                    Architecture from UVU after she finishes a bachelor's degree in 
                    Software Engineering at Snow Collge. Sarah is passionate about 
                    homesteading, self-sufficiency, and learning. She taught herself how 
                    to use the professional-level architectural software Home Designer 
                    Pro by building a replica of the 4,600-square-foot home she grew up 
                    in and has also taken a personal interest in learning about passive 
                    solar home design, optimization of floorplan layouts, and the basics 
                    of architecture in her spare time. Having been an artist ever since 
                    she was little, Sarah brings her strengths at visual design to the
                    table to make sure you can end up with a custom home design that you 
                    love.
